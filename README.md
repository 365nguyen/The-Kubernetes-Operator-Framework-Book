This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the basics of infrastructure as code patterns and practices
* Get an overview of Git command and Git flow
* Install and write Packer, Terraform, and Ansible code for provisioning and configuring cloud infrastructure based on Azure examples
* Use Vagrant to create a local development environment
* Containerize applications with Docker and Kubernetes
* Apply DevSecOps for testing compliance and securing DevOps infrastructure
* Build DevOps CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, Azure Pipelines, and GitLab CI
